# n8n Playground

This repository is a personal learning and experimentation space for
understanding **n8n** and workflow automation from a **product and systems
perspective**.

The goal of this playground is not to showcase complex automation, but to
demonstrate **progressive learning**: starting with core concepts and
gradually moving toward more realistic, production-oriented workflows.

Each project is intentionally small, focused, and added incrementally.

## How to use this repository

If you are new to n8n, start here:

- **`00-understanding-n8n`**  
  A plain-language introduction to what n8n is, how it works, and where it
  fits in modern product, operations, and automation workflows.

Then continue through the projects in order:

- **`01-hello-n8n`**  
  A first hands-on workflow that introduces triggers, nodes, and execution
  flow.

- **`02-api-integration`**  
  Demonstrates how n8n connects to external systems using APIs and how data
  flows between n
