# n8n Playground

This repository is a personal learning and experimentation space for
understanding **n8n** and workflow automation from a **product and systems
perspective**.

The goal of this playground is not to showcase complex automation, but to
demonstrate **progressive learning**: starting with core concepts and
gradually moving toward more realistic, production-oriented workflows.

Each project is intentionally small, focused, and added incrementally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to use this repository

If you are new to n8n, start here:

- **`00-understanding-n8n`**  
  A plain-language introduction to what n8n is, how it works, and where it
  fits in modern product, operations, and automation workflows.

Then continue through the projects in order:

- **`01-hello-n8n`**  
  A first hands-on workflow that introduces triggers, nodes, and execution
  flow.

- **`02-api-integration`**  
  Demonstrates how n8n connects to external systems using APIs and how data
  flows between nodes.

- **`03-business-logic`**  
  Introduces conditional logic, branching, and decision-making inside
  workflows.

- **`04-product-operations`**  
  Realistic automation examples relevant to product and operations teams,
  such as notifications, intake flows, and internal tooling.

- **`05-error-handling`**  
  Focuses on reliability, error handling, and failure awareness in automated
  systems.

- **`06-scalable-design`**  
  Explores scalable workflow design concepts such as webhooks, reusable
  workflows, and environment configuration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why this repository exists

This playground focuses on:

- Understanding **workflow automation concepts**, not just tool usage
- Thinking in terms of **systems, data flow, and constraints**
- Exploring how automation supports **product, operations, and growth teams**
- Building technical fluency relevant to **technical Product Manager roles**

The emphasis is on *reasoning and structure* rather than volume or complexity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About the approach

- Projects are intentionally scoped and progressive
- Each folder represents a learning milestone
- Workflows are designed to reflect real-world use cases
- Git history reflects gradual understanding over time

This mirrors how automation tools are learned and applied in real teams.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Notes

All workflows use simplified or fictional examples for learning purposes.
This repository is not intended to represent production automation.
