# Hello n8n

This project is the first hands-on workflow in this playground.

It introduces the most basic n8n building blocks:

- A **trigger** to start the workflow
- A **Set node** to create and structure sample data
- A **final output step** to confirm the workflow executed successfully

The goal is not to build a useful automation yet, but to build confidence
in how workflows execute and how data moves between nodes.

## What this project demonstrates

- How a workflow is triggered
- How nodes pass data forward
- How to inspect node outputs during execution
- How to structure information into consistent fields

## Output

This workflow produces a simple payload such as:

- name
- role
- learning_goal
- timestamp

This becomes the foundation for future projects that work with APIs, logic,
and real integrations.
